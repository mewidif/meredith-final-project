          Lemonade is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter
          Beyoncé. It was released on April 23, 2016, by Parkwood Entertainment
          and Columbia Records, accompanied by a 65-minute film of the same
          title. It follows her self-titled fifth studio album (2013), and is a
          concept album with a song cycle that relates Beyoncé&#39;s emotional
          journey after her husband&#39;s infidelity in a generational and
          racial context. Primarily an R&amp;B and art pop album, Lemonade
          encompasses a variety of genres, including reggae, blues, rock, hip
          hop, soul, funk, Americana, country, gospel, electronic, and trap. It
          features guest vocals from James Blake, Kendrick Lamar, the Weeknd,
          and Jack White, and contains samples and interpolations of a number of
          hip hop and rock songs.

          Beyoncé is the self-titled fifth studio album by American singer and
          songwriter Beyoncé. It was released on December 13, 2013, through
          Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. Developed as a visual
          album, every song is accompanied by a non-linear short film that
          illustrates the musical concepts. Beyoncé&#39;s desire to assert her
          full artistic freedom served as inspiration for the album&#39;s dark,
          personal subject matter, which incorporated feminist themes of sex,
          monogamy, beauty standards and relationship problems.

          <p>2011</p>
          Following a career hiatus which reignited her creativity, Beyoncé was
          inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional rhythm and
          blues that stood apart from contemporary pop. Her collaborations with
          songwriters and record producers The-Dream, Tricky Stewart and Shea
          Taylor produced a mellower tone, developing diverse vocal styles and
          influences from funk, hip hop, and soul music. Severing professional
          ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed the
          music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal
          album. Lyrical themes of 4 emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and
          self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to
          contend artistic credibility.

          In its original release, I Am... Sasha Fierce was formatted as a
          double album, intending to market Beyoncé&#39;s dichotomous artistic
          persona. The first disc I Am... contains slow and midtempo pop and
          R&amp;B ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce–titled after
          Beyoncé&#39;s on-stage alter ego–focuses on more uptempo beats that
          blend electropop and Europop elements. In composing the songs&#39;
          lyrics, Beyoncé worked with writers, with each session accompanied by
          live orchestration. Musically, I Am... drew inspiration from folk and
          alternative rock, while blending acoustic guitar elements into
          contemporary ballads, and its tracks were written and produced by
          Beyoncé, during collaborative efforts with Babyface, Tricky Stewart,
          The-Dream and Ryan Tedder. Meanwhile, Sasha Fierce boasted production
          from Darkchild and Sean Garrett.

          B&#39;Day was influenced by a variety of American genres, and, like
          Dangerously in Love (2003), incorporated urban contemporary elements
          such as contemporary R&amp;B and hip hop. Some songs showcase 1970s
          and 1980s styles, achieved through record sampling. &quot;Suga
          Mama&quot;, which employs blues-guitar samples from Jake Wade and the
          Soul Searchers&#39; &quot;Searching for Soul&quot;, contains a 1970s
          funk and 1980s go-go-influenced melody. &quot;Upgrade U&quot; uses a
          sample from Betty Wright&#39;s 1968 song &quot;Girls Can&#39;t Do What
          the Guys Do&quot;. &quot;Resentment&quot; used Curtis Mayfield&#39;s
          &quot;Think&quot; from the 1972 Super Fly soundtrack. &quot;Déjà
          Vu&quot; has 1970s influence, &quot;Green Light&quot; has a classic
          groove, and &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot; features twang, a musical style
          that originated from Texas.

          Lyrically, love was the theme Beyoncé had incorporated for Dangerously
          in Love the most. Surrounding the release of the album, there were
          persistent rumors of her relationship with Jay-Z, which would later be
          proven true. Though &quot;most the material is vague enough to be
          about any relationship&quot;, the album consists multiple tracks
          suggesting affirmation of their relationship. On &quot;Signs&quot;,
          Beyoncé sings about being in love with a Sagittarius, Jay-Z&#39;s
          zodiac sign. With a theme based upon different stages of a romantic
          relationship, the album contains tracks speaking of romance and
          honesty.
