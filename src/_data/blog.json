          "value": "Beyoncé conceived and recorded Renaissance during the COVID-19 pandemic, seeking to inspire joy and escapism in listeners who had experienced isolation and to celebrate a club era in which marginalized people sought liberation through dance music. With its songs seamlessly arranged like a DJ mix, the album blends post-1970s Black dance music styles such as disco and house and pays homage to the Black and queer pioneers of those genres. The album's lyrical content explores themes of escapism, hedonism, self-assurance and self-expression."

          "value": "Although many have labeled it a country album, Cowboy Carter blends diverse musical genres including pop, hip hop, trap, psychedelic funk, blues, soul, rock, rock and roll, opera, \"Irish\" jig, and folk music. Conceptually, the album is presented as a radio broadcast by a fictitious station called \"KNTRY Radio Texas\", with country singers Dolly Parton, Linda Martell, and Willie Nelson acting as disc jockeys. The album's songs feature lesser-known Black country artists such as Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts, Shaboozey, and Willie Jones. The music is driven by a range of acoustic instruments played by musicians including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Nile Rodgers, Jon Batiste, Gary Clark Jr., and Rhiannon Giddens."
